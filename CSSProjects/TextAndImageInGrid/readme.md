1. HTML special symbols like arrow. here it is used to display button
2. zoom-in a image when you hover the mouse.
3. we use outline to show a highlight border and it also has a offset property which the 'border' property does not have.
4. This is for zomming out on all other elements which are not hovered.
     - As soon as you hover the composition element.
     - Select the photo which is nested inside of the composition element 
     - and select the photo which is not hovered.
   
     Note : if something does not work internally...try to do it from outer element.
     Note : Sometimes you might have to remove some properties to check if a particular css property is working or not.
     Note : if you use the position as absolute then the height of the element collapses.
