12. perspective : when a card rotates - you use perspective to make an effect appear closer to you.

13. if child elements are taken out of their natural flow i.e if position of absolute is used then the parent's height collapses.
14. transtion : this has a transition timing function which by default is linear.

15. background-blend-mode : describes how the background images of the elements should blend + i.e blending with a linear gradient
background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, $color-primary-light,$color-primary-dark), url(./img/nat-5.jpg);
    with the above code we will just get the full cover over the image.. if the color is tranparent then it looks fine..but
    to get the gradient from left to right we need to set the background blen mode

16. if the image is overflowing its parent then : on the parent we use overflow:hidden
