1. h1 : Used by Search Engine Optimizations.
        We dont want to split the header so we use span.
     
2. To display the heading in two lines we use the display:block property
        block : Block level elements occupy the entire width available.
                They create line break after and before them.

3. span : its an inline element.   

4. transform: translate(-50%,-50%) : This is no longer in relation to the parent element But the element itself.
                                     This will move the element left and top by half of its width and height respectively.

5. position : absolute -> to put the element in a particular place. parent must have position of relative.
